# Data Access

This project uses the **Cell2Cell Churn dataset** from the KDD Cup 2009 competition.

The dataset can be access from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jpacse/datasets-for-churn-telecom/data).

Due to licensing restrictions, the raw data file is not stored in this repository.

## To run this project:

1. Download the dataset manually from Kaggle.
2. Place the raw `cell2celltrain.csv` file in this `data/` folder.

This file will be used in all preprocessing and modeling steps.
